I’ve always been someone who gets excited about what's next. 

Whether it’s a new AI model that changes how we think or a complex actuarial problem that needs a fresh perspective, I find myself wanting to talk about it. But for a long time, I just kept those thoughts to myself.

**Sutra** is my way of changing that.

### Finding the "Thread"

I chose the name *Sutra* because it means a thread. To me, it’s about finding the common thread between the data-heavy world of risk and the fast-paced world of technology. I wanted a place to distill these big, complicated ideas into something simple and clear.

### The Journey to Now

It took me a while to get here. I spent months playing with designs, changing the name, and overthinking the "perfect" setup. I went from a complex dark mode to this simple, clean look you see now. 

That journey taught me something important: the best way to start is just to *start*. 

### What to Expect

I'm not here to write 50-page textbooks. I’m here to share:
-   Quick insights on AI and Actuarial science.
-   The "exciting" things I find in tech.
-   My own journey of learning and discovery.

Thanks for joining me on this first thread. I can't wait to see where it leads!
