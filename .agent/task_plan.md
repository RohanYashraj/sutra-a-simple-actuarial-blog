# Task Plan: Website Look & Feel Update

## Goal
Update the website look and feel with high-quality customization and a GSAP-powered hero section to make the website stand apart.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Initialization [x]
- [x] Initialize planning files (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
- [x] Install `gsap` dependency
- [x] Check for `gsap` in package.json

### Phase 2: Hero Section Implementation [x]
- [x] Design `Hero` component concept (Minimalist yet dynamic)
- [x] Create `components/Hero.tsx`
- [x] Implement initial generic GSAP animations (fade-in, stagger)
- [x] Refine animations for "Great" feel (e.g., split text, mouse interaction, or smooth reveals)

### Phase 3: Integration & Global Customization [x]
- [x] Integrate `Hero` into `app/page.tsx`
- [x] Remove old header code
- [x] Review other sections for "nice customization" opportunities (e.g., smooth scrolling, hover effects)

### Phase 4: Verification [x]
- [x] Verify build (run `npm run build` locally if possible, or check dev server)
- [x] Check console for errors (using browser tool or user feedback)
- [x] Review visual quality (Self-Verify code)
